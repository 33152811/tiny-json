# JSON library for Delphi

This is a small and clean library for associative arrays with Boolean / Integer / Float / WideString values. 
Allows import (export) from (to) JSON text. Extensive error-checking. 

Some open-source projects I would like to give credit:

* [FunHash](https://github.com/funny-falcon/funny_hash) by Sokolov Yura
* [HatTrie](https://github.com/dcjones/hat-trie) by Daniel C. Jones
* FastInt64 - _unknown source_
* [FastMove](http://fastcode.sourceforge.net/challenge_content/FastMove.html) by FastCode project

The library was built for the ease of use and clean understandable code - performance was not a first priority so I have not made any benchmarking.
